            <p class="introP introP1 opa">I am Ali Rajaii a full-stack Web-Developer. Originally I studied psychology and finance. I got a job to make money after school, but was not satisfied because I felt I was not engaging my creative or intellectual side at all. That changed as I put diligent effort towards my goal of becoming a software engineer. I'm still on the learning path, and always will be in this field. It keeps me sharp and scintillates both my intellect, and my creativity.</p>

            <p class="introP opa">My main interest is full-stack web-development. I am currently writing a social-media platform that will serve a niche audience, in my free-time. I recently finished Lambda School, a coding immersion.  At Lambda we worked on a wide range of projects that taught us the core of software development. Check out some of my work.</p>
