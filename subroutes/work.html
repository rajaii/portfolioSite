        <p class="workp">I have spent many months learning to write software. Currently my core skillset includes HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript, Node.js, React, Redux, and Python. My time at Lambda School has proven useful. I set my mind to learn how to code, and with time and dedication have completed many projects, and have a solid understanding of both computer science and web development.  Here are some of the projects I have worked on.</p>
