            <p>I take interest in many aspects of software development. Of particular interest are web-development and computer science. Currently, I have completed a few projects, and I am working on a major project; an application that will serve as a social media platform for a specified target user-group.</p>
            <p>In my personal life I enjoy many wonderful hobbies. I am a martial artist, a musician, a social being, an avid reader, and a spiritual seeker. I find writing software to be very helpful with the spiritual process. It forces me to be more mindful. If I am not in a pseudo-meditative state when writing code, I will not solve the problems I am facing. I am still early in my career as a software engineer, but I will post my successes on here as I progress for all to see. Thank you for taking the time to visit my site.</p>
